**Track:** Top Project Using Starknet and EigenLayer Bounties
**Description:** Participants in this track a AML Transaction Compliance AVS. 
DeFi platforms are increasingly targeted for money laundering and illicit activities due to their pseudonymous and decentralized nature. Traditional AML compliance relies on centralized intermediaries, which can be points of corruption and failure. The AML Transaction Compliance AVS developed by him addresses these challenges by providing a decentralized, trust-minimized solution for monitoring and flagging suspicious transactions. By eliminating intermediaries, the AVS prevents corruption and ensures that compliance checks are transparent, auditable, and resilient against manipulation. This enhances the security and integrity of DeFi protocols, fosters regulatory compliance, and builds trust among users and stakeholders.
