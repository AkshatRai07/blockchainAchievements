*Track:* Multi-Party Computation Cursive Protocol 
*Description:* [PrivInsure](https://github.com/prateushsharma/ZK-Insurance?tab=readme-ov-file#privinsure) is a privacy-preserving application that leverages Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to allow individuals to determine their eligibility for insurance policies without revealing their personal health data or the insurer's policy requirements. Using cutting-edge cryptographic techniques, [PrivInsure](https://github.com/prateushsharma/ZK-Insurance?tab=readme-ov-file#privinsure) ensures that both parties can securely compute the eligibility criteria while maintaining full confidentiality.
